/*
Given a 2D array of distinct integers with n numbers, "compress" the array such that the resulting array's numbers are in
the range [1, n] and their relative order is kept.

Relative order means that if a number at position (row1, col1) is smaller than a number at position (row2, col2) in the
original array, it should still have that relationship in the resulting array.

Example:
Input:
7 6
4 9

Output:
3 2
1 4

Followup:
Compress the array to make the numbers as small as possible as long as the relative order holds true for numbers in the
same row and column.

Example1:
Input:
7 6
4 9

Output:
2 1
1 2

Example2:
Input:
25 74 54
12 56 83

Output:
2 4 3
1 2 4

Example3:
Input:
20 80 60 70
11 90 22 44
33 99 49 88

Output:
2 7 5 6
1 8 2 3
3 9 4 7
